# turbScalarTransportSimpleFoam
This is a combination of two solvers i.e. scalarTransportFoam and simpleFoam for the turbulent transport of the scalars. The code developed is used for a passive transport of the pollutants such as CO, COx, NOx, etc . Hence, the solver aims to model the pollutant dispersion phenomenon using CFD techniques in opensource software OpenFOAM.
