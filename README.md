# turbScalarTransportSimpleFoam
This is a combination of two solvers i.e. scalarTransportFoam and simpleFoam for the turbulent transport of the scalars. The code developed is used for a passive transport of the pollutants such as CO, COx, NOx, etc . Hence, the solver aims to model the pollutant dispersion phenomenon using CFD techniques in opensource software OpenFOAM. 
Four sources of the passive scalar are added in the leeward side of the cubical building. These represent the source of the pollutant moving at velocity of 0.024m/s. Turbulent Schmidt number(Sct) and molecular diffusivity(Dt) terms can be adjusted via /test_case/constant/transportProperties/. Hence the solver is developed to compare the experimental results from CEDVAL with the CFD simulation.
